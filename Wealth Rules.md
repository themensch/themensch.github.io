We're going to use these wealth rules:

[Wealth Rules](https://drivethrurpg.com/en/product/345921/wealth-a-ruleset-for-funds-and-commerce-in-genesys)

Everyone starts with one free rank in the Wealth Skill.

Additionally, since our setting is on the frontier, there is a +2 modifier to all Rarity calculations  (core rulebook pg 83) but this only applies for gear purchased after character generation.
