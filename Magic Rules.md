Magic is no more than the ability to perceive a new layer of reality beyond what most senses perceive.  This layer is connected by mycelium that manifest as mushrooms in "normal" space.

Magic actions are available by rank, starting with perceptive and minor magical actions and culminating in truly transformative powers as the magic user learned the subtleties of the nature of the universe and their place with it.
