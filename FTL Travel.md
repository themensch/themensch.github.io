Human-based FTL travel is brute force bending of physics to their will until the universe knuckles under.  It requires enormous power, and ships below silhouette 6 cannot normally host an FTL drive and must be ferried by a larger vessel.  Several companies exist to transport ships and they compete fiercely so prices remain reasonable.  

The typical interstellar ferry has a hold for docked ships and cabins - and while crews are welcome to stay on their ship for the duration, many opt to pay for accommodations and enjoy the services aboard.  There are different levels of accommodation, ranging from economy class to royal class, with commensurate amenities.
