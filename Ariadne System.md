The Ariadne system is a binary star system dominated by two red dwarfs spiraling towards their eventual demise. At the heart of this system lies a stunning emerald gas giant, three times the size of Jupiter and positioned just beyond the habitable zone. This giant is orbited by several large moons, including smaller "moon moons," where our story unfolds—particularly on Ariadne 4b.1.

Ariadne 4b.1, a diminutive, muddy world, fiercely holds onto its thin atmosphere. About 500 years ago, it was identified as a potential candidate for terraforming. Today, the moon moon experiences predictable yet extremely varied seasons: three dry periods interspersed with two wet seasons. During the dry times, high clouds often form, tinting the red light from the stars orange—a spectacle caused by volatile gases in the atmosphere. In contrast, the wet seasons bring dense clouds that cast a reddish-purple gloom lasting weeks.

Thanks to centuries of terraforming, the climate on Ariadne 4b.1 is now hospitable, although the atmosphere outside deep, rocky canyons remains barely breathable. Heavier breathable gases collect in these low-lying areas, making them the prime locations for settlements. Outside these canyons, residents must wear breath masks or even environmental suits. Most inhabitants reside in habitats carved into the canyon walls, though some hardier native and non-native species can survive on the surface without assistance.

Initially targeted as a farming colony due to its predictable climate, Ariadne 4b.1 has recently become the center of attention for another reason: the discovery of subterranean crystals. One type, a common euphoric, is based on a salt compound that many use recreationally. However, a much rarer variant—almost identical in appearance—has been found to significantly extend life in humans and human-like species. This has triggered a rush, attracting an influx of workers eager to extract these valuable crystals. These individuals often live in makeshift surface accommodations, leading to a societal split between those living "in the canyon" (the Ins) and those outside (the Outs).

The recent surge in population and machinery from distant ports has overwhelmed the infrastructure of Ariadne 4b.1. Additionally, the arrival of foreign parasites with inadequately screened prospectors has significantly increased the workload for the local health teams.
